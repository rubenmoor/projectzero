* [The most basic, yet complete setup for multiplayer](BasicMultiplayer.md) Getting your project setup
  right, to eventually implement single player, split/shared screen, LAN and online multiplayer - no need
  to pay for a plugin
* [Simulation of Newtonian Gravitation for movement of planets, asteroids, space stations you name it
  - along their respective orbits](KeplerOrbits.md) Orbits are determined analytically based on the initial
  conditions, i.e. distance from center and speed, and implemented as splines.
* [Physical gyration of a static mesh with torque-free precession](PhysicalGyration.md) Implementing
  continuous rotation for a mesh without relying on Unreal's  `simulate physics`, featuring [torque-free
  precession (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession) for free
