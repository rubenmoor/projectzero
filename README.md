* [Simulation of Kepler orbits for planets and alike](KeplerOrbits.md) Orbits are determined analytically based on the initial
  conditions, i.e. distance from center and speed, and implemented as splines along which the object then moves
* [Physical gyration of a static mesh with torque-free precession](PhysicalGyration.md) Implementing
  continuous rotation for a mesh without relying on Unreal's  `simulate physics`, featuring [torque-free
  precession (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession) for free
